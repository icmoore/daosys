DAOs fail to reflect the ethos of cryptocurrency.
The fundamental value proposition of cryptocurrency is self-sovereign capital.

Currently, DAOs take ownership of users' capital to be managed in a treasury controlled by a few individuals.
Tantamount to not controlling the keys to your own wallet.
And current governance solutions are not suited to respecting stakeholder value.
This is further compounded with the typical disconnect between DAOs governance token and the protocol's actual value proposition.
