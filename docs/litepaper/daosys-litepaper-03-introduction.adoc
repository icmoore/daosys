DAOSYS aims to resolve the DAO mission statement to governance gap with a revolutionary model for coordinating cryptocurrency as capital investments.
Our vision is that DAOs should operate more like pure AMMs.
An autonomous and permissionless protocol anyone can use to consume the services of the DAO.
Effectively acting as autonomous economic agents.
This means that DAOs have to mature from the current phase of maximizing capital extraction.
The economics must be tailored to facilitate the DAOs mission statement.
And must be implemented in a manner that does not require external controls.

Previously, this was nearly impossible to achieve with the state of smart-contract and defi design.
But, by iterating on the AMM model to generalize the process it's possible to deploy DAOs as easily as we can deploy a liquidity pool.
By applying antifragile tokenomics and integrations with defi protocols a treasury management platform can be realized without the need for a governance token.
This way, DAOs can leverage existing markets as the foundation for coordinating capital to execute their mission statement.
This technology is provided in the technology behind DAOSYS, the Autonomous Service Engine.

DAOSYS will consist of a reference architecture using the Autonomous Service Engine.
This will make Syscoin a hotbed of innovation through the self-sovereign asset management.
The antifragile market design results in a risk-mitigating funding mechanism.
This shifts the primary funding risk toward simple opportunity cost.
Leading to some incredible efficiencies for the Syscoin Foundation's treasury and for others who participate.
DAOSYS will be advantageously positioned to foster the roots of digital value.
This position will drive the advancement of Syscoin's ecosystem.
A full-stack Layer 1 blockchain with a modular design that supports a scalable Layer 2.

This initiative and its DAOSYS implementation will fulfill goals of the nonprofit Syscoin Foundation to provide the advancements necessary for DAO technology to disrupt for-profit corporate and NGO finance by becoming a go-to driver of innovation.
