Ichi provides vaults to produce filly collateralized stable coins pegged to $1. Below is our due diligence to ensure which information is not readily available for further discussions with ICHI. 

=== What stable coins does ICHI accept for the reserve providing collateral for the stable coins.

==== Angel Vaults

To see which tokens ICUI accepts, goto the https://app.ichi.org/vault/[LP vault page], active tokens include:

* USDC (stable)
* QRDO
* oneICHI (stable)
* ICHI

These tokens are not active as of yet:

* oneFUSE (stable)
* FUSE
* oneGIV (stable)
* GIV

==== HODL Vaults

To see which tokens ICUI accepts, goto the https://app.ichi.org/hodlvault[HODL vault page], active tokens include:

* wNXM
* wBTC
* 1INCH
* CEL
* GNO
* FUSE
* BNT
* ALLY

=== What types of vaults does ICHI offer?

* https://app.ichi.org/vault[Angel Vaults]: Uniswap v3 liquidty management protocol claiming to be the most successful liquidity strategy in DeFi without having to actively manage their pool positions.
* https://app.ichi.org/hodlvault[HODL Vaults]: Uniswap v3 liquidty management protocol that Utilize single-sided concentrated liquidty pools created with a project's native token

Goto https://app.ichi.org/vault/[LP vault page], active LP vaults with liquidity include:

* oneICHI-IHCI
* USDC-ICHI

Non-active LP vaults with no liquidity include:

* USDC-QRDO
* oneFUSE-FUSE
* oneGIV-GIV

=== What strategies are implemented in the types of ICHI vaults?

* https://app.ichi.org/vault[Angel Vaults]: Works by continually establishing new price floors via buyers of last resort by building buy-walls of liquidity to protect a token's price. It works by pairing dollar pegged assets (called the deposit token) to provide this price protection for the other token (called the paired token). Rebalancing is done on an as-needed basis. Monitoring is done automatically, but rebalancing is done via ICHI governance. The deposit tokens utilizes 'Branded Dollars' which empower communities claim ownership of their own liqudity; these are on-chain stable tokens worth $1, and are supported by a community treasury.

* https://app.ichi.org/hodlvault[HODL Vaults]: Works by users earning trading fees in exchange for the liquidity deposits of users. The HODL vault takes single-sided deposits called the deposit token. At the point of withdraw, users will receive a combination of the project's token and ICHI. Rebalances happen on an as-needed basis, and are managed in the same way as Angel vaults. 

=== What defi protocols are ICHI vaults dependent upon?

Both Angel and HODL vault depend on Uniswap v3

=== Identify which defi protocol dependencies have compatible versions on the Syscoin NEVM chain.

=== Define the revenue stream source for projects the vaults are intended to support.

=== How is the interest of the integrated strategies distributed?

=== Define the value proposition to users depositing into the vaults.
