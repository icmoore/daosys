== DAOSYS Introduction

The objective of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is to solve the principal-agent dilemma. This dilemma is a result of misaligned incentives where agents acting in a system are incentivized towards their own benefit over the benefit of a principle or other agents acting within the system. Typically, these are found in centralized systems where the central acting authority is the main compromised agent. The DAO solves this by decentralizing the governance process by utilizing smart contracts running on open source blockchains.

The first inception of the DAO concept happened in May 2016 out of the Ethereum community, which was known as Genesis DAO, and was built as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. However, this resulted in the well known DAO Hack which resulted in the draining of $60M USD worth of funds from its treasury. Today, there are many DAOs in operation with Uniswap, Aave and Maker DAO being amongst the most popular. However, these DAOs still fundamentally violate the core value proposition of self sovereignty that crypto currency promises, where DAOs currently take ownership of capital managed in a treasury controlled by a few individuals. This is the problem that DAOSYS intends to address.

DAOSYS vision is to operate like a pure automated market maker (AMM) and be implemented in a manner that does not require external controls. It addresses this core issue via its new Autonomous Service Engine (ASE) technology hence allowing DAOs to be more autonomous and fully decentralized. One of the interesting by-products of this technology will allow users to test, implement and realize countless decentralized finance (DeFi) usecase designs.


== Masternode Yield Farming

=== Syscoin Masternodes
Masternodes are special nodes in a blockchain infrastructure that perform special roles in governing the blockchain. They typically verify new blocks of transaction, and operate on a collateral-based system where operators need to own a certain amount of the cryptocurrency where the node owners are rewarded with guaranteed earnings at intermittent intervals. They were first implemented in 2014 on the Dash network, which is a fork of Bitcoin. Since then many other crypto projections began implementing them and were popularized shortly after the 2nd Bitcoin halvening during the bull run that preceded in 2016.

Syscoinâ€™s masternode network went live in June 2019 for their 3.0 release. The collateral requirement to operate a Syscoin masternode is 100,000 SYS. At the time of this writing (Aug 2022), there are approximately 2,500 masternodes in the Syscoin network representing 38.5% of locked supply. Operators currently receive ~14 SYS base rewards per day. As a seniority benefit, Masternode operators receive a 35% bonus to their base reward after one year, and a 100% bonus after two and a half years

=== Yield Farming
This is a technique that uses DeFi to maximize returns where investors submit liquidity to a decentralized application (ie, dApp) to earn yield on their principle using various methods. These methods are classified into four main types which include: staking, lending, borrowing, and utilizing liquidity providers, which is largely done on a decentralized exchange (DEX). This technology is facilitated via blockchain smart contracts (first popularized by the Ethereum protocol in 2015), which are pieces of code that automate financial agreements between two or more parties in a trustless manner. 

=== Putting it together
In Dec 2021, Syscoin released the first stage of its Network Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM) which utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In the coming months (from the time of this publication), this will include a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system to build layer 2 (L2) scalable applications, and one of the first of these applications will be DAOSYS. 

Syscoin plans to incentivize masternode operators where they can put yields to work by investing them into a DeFi liquidity provider which will be automated in a trustless manner through DAOSYS. Hence, extending the Syscoin ecosystem, and increasing daily volumes. This system of trustlessly investing Masternode yields into a DeFi liquidity provider is what we call Masternode Yield Farming, which will serve as the first intended usecase for DAOSYS and be the first of its kind in the crypto space.
