The ASE makes use of https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165] as sanity checks for interacting with other contracts as part of the ecosystem.
Every part of the ASE, services, delegate service, and deployed proxies, is expected to expose the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165] interface.
Service Proxies update the ERC165 storage with their mapped delegate services upon deployment.

This is a DDSA compliant implementation of https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165].

*Documentation Pending final implementation.*

// TODO Write docs for implementation.
