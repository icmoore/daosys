The Proxy design pattern utilizes the DELEGATECALL OPCODE of the EVM to reuse another smart-contract's logic.
A proxy is implemented to use DELEGATECALL for most of it's functionality.
This is done by deploying a small contract that uses DELEGATECALL to the contract that implements it's logic for any undefined functions.
There are several standards that define how a proxy can be configured ot updated to use a particular implementation.
The ASE defines it's own optimized standard.
This optimized standard combines the Minimal Proxy reference implementation with a slimmer version of the Diamond reference implementation.
