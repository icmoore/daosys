The schedule shown is for the launch MVP of DAOSYS.
Because the current defi ecosystem does not provide sufficient utility for $SYS or $WSYS the remaining 4 months is reserved for designing and expanding the current ecosystem with DAOSYS integrations.
The launch MVP is intended to provide the base functionality of decentralized capital coordination to fund development.
Relying upon the DEX market created with the DAOSYS vault tokens.
This provides the baseline market that can be used as the index for additional defi protocols.
The time between launch and integration with defi protocols allows for real market data for those protocols to assess for their configuration.
Such as interest rates collateralization requirements.
