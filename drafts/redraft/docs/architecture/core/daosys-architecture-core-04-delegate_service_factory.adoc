The ASE Delegate Service Factory (DSF) Delegate Service allows for deploying new Delegate Services to be published through the <<ASE Delegate Service Registry Delegate Service>>.
The ASE DSF accepts new bytecode and the ERC165 interface ID for a new delegate service.
The ASE DSF then deploys that bytecode using `create2` to salt the deployment with the provided interface ID.
Upon deployment the new Delegate Service registers itself with the ASE Delegate Service Registry Delegate Service.
The registration process is documented in the Delegate Service and Delegate Service Registry documentation.

// TODO include NatSpec generated docs.
